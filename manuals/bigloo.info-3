29 SRFIs
********

Bigloo supports various SRFIs (Scheme Request For Implementation). Some
of them are integrated in the Bigloo core libraries. Some others are
implemented by the means of Bigloo libraries (*note Bigloo
Libraries::). Only the first ones are described in the manual.

  The current Bigloo core library support the following SRFIs:

   * `srfi-0' (Conditional execution).

   * `srfi-2' (AND-LET*: an AND with local bindings, a guarded LET*
     special form).

   * `srfi-6' (Basic String Ports).

   * `srfi-8' (Binding to multiple values).

   * `srfi-9' (_Records_ specification).

   * `srfi-18' (Multithreading support).

   * `srfi-22' (Script interpreter invocation).

   * `srfi-28' (Basic Format Strings).

   * `srfi-30' (Multi-line comments).

   * `srfi-34' (Exception Handling for Programs).

29.1 SRFI 0
===========

 -- bigloo syntax: cond-expand [clause]
     The `cond-expand' form tests for the existence of features at
     macro-expansion time. It either expands into the body of one of its
     clauses or signals and error during syntactic processing.
     `cond-expand' expands into the body of the first clause whose
     feature requirement is currently satisfied (the `else' clause, if
     present, is selected if none of the previous clauses is selected).

     A feature requirement has an obvious interpretation as a logical
     formula, where the variables have meaning _true_ is the feature
     corresponding to the feature identifier, as specified in the _SRFI_
     registry, is in effect at the location of the `cond-expand' form,
     and _false_ otherwise. A feature requirement is satisfied it its
     formula is true under this interpretation. The formula may make
     use of identifier, `and', `or' and `not' operators.

     Since Bigloo version 3.1b, `cond-expand' formula may use the new
     `library' operator that checks if a library exists and is
     available.  Its syntax is: `(library <libname>)'.

     Examples:

          (write (cond-expand
                    (srfi-0 (* 1 2))
                    ((or (library fthread) (library pthread)) (- 4 1))
                    (else (+ 3 4))))
             -| 2

          (cond-expand
             (bigloo (define (command-line-arguments) (command-line)))
             (else (define (command-line-arguments) '())))

     The second example assumes that `bigloo' is an alias for the SRFI
     associated with the specification of Bigloo (i.e. the
     documentation for that Scheme system).

     Since Bigloo 3.4b, `cond-expand' formula may use the new `config'
     operator that checks the value of a configuration entry.  Its
     syntax is: `(config endianeness little-endian)'. This feature
     relies on the `bigloo-config' function. See *note System
     Programming:: for additional details.

     When writing portable code, the case used for the feature
     identifier should match the one in the SRFI registry. This is to
     ensure that the feature identifier will be correctly recognized
     whether or not the Scheme system is case-sensitive. To support
     case-insensitive Scheme systems, the feature identifiers in the
     SRFI registry are guaranteed to be unique even when ignoring the
     case.

     In order to distinguish Bigloo versions, the following symbols are
     recognized in `cond-expand' forms.

        * `bigloo'

        * `bigloo<branch-release>'

        * `bigloo<major-release>'

        * `bigloo<major-release><minor-release>'

     When finalizers have been configured, the two following symbols are
     recognized by `cond-expand':

        * `bigloo-finalizer'

        * `bigloo-weakptr'

     Bigloo implements differents SRFI for the compiler and the
     interpreter.  Thus, their are two Bigloo SRFI registers. One for
     the compiler and one for the interpreter. Bigloo compiler SRFI
     register contains at least the following symbols:

        * `srfi-0'

        * `srfi-1'

        * `srfi-2'

        * `srfi-6'

        * `srfi-8'

        * `srfi-9'

        * `srfi-22'

        * `srfi-28'

        * `srfi-30'

     With respect to the currently used Bigloo back-end, one of these
     symbols is registered:

        * `bigloo-c'

        * `bigloo-jvm'

     Bigloo compiler implements the following SRFI:

        * `bigloo'

        * `bigloo-compile'

        * `bigloo<major-release>'

        * `bigloo<major-release><minor-release>'

     Then the `-g' flag is used, the Bigloo compiler additionally
     implements the SRFI:

        * `bigloo-debug'

     Bigloo interpreter implements the following SRFI:

        * `bigloo'

        * `bigloo-eval'

        * `bigloo<major-release>'

        * `bigloo<major-release><minor-release>'

     When a library is used, the name of the library is added to the
     compiler SRFI register. That is:

          (module foo
             (library srfi1))

          (print (cond-expand (srfi1 'with-srfi1) (else 'nothing)))
             -| 'with-srfi1
          (print (eval '(cond-expand (srfi1 'with-srfi1) (else 'nothing))))
             -| 'with-srfi1

 -- bigloo procedure: register-eval-srfi! srfi-name
     This argument SRFI-NAME is a symbol. It registers SRFI-NAME in the
     Bigloo interpreter SRFI register. This function must only be used
     when implementing a library. The code of that library must contain
     one unique call to `register-eval-srfi!'. Let's suppose, for
     instance, a `format' library. The implementation for that library
     must contain an expression like:

          (register-eval-srfi! 'format)

     Calling `(register-eval-srfi! name)' makes `name' supported by
     interpreted `cond-expand' forms.

     _Note:_ There is no `register-compiler-srfi!' because the compiler
     automatically registers SRFI when the `-library' flags are used.
     However, it exists several ways to tell the compiler that it
     actually supports some srfis when compiling some modules.

        * The first way is to insert calls to `register-eval-srfi!' in
          the `.bigloorc' file (*note Compiler Description::).

        * The second, is to use `option' (*note Module Declaration::)
          module clause, such as:

               (module example
                  ...
                  (option (register-srfi! 'srfi-foobar)))

               ...

        * The last way is to use the command line option `-srfi' (*note
          Compiler Description::).


29.2 SRFI 1
===========

The SRFI 1 is implemented as a Bigloo library. Hence, in order to use
the functions it provides, a module must import it.

     (module ex
        (library srfi1))

     (print (find-tail even? '(3 1 37 -8 -5 0 0)))
      => '(-8 -5 0 0))

29.3 SRFI 22
============

The SRFI 22 describes basic prerequisites for running Scheme programs as
Unix scripts in a uniform way. A file (henceforth a _scipt_) conforming
SRFI 22 has the following syntax:

     <script>         ==> <script prelude>? <program>
     <script prelude> ==> `#!' <space> <all but linebreak>* <linebreak>

  A Scheme script interpreter loads the `<script>'. It ignores the
script prelude and interprets the rest of the file according to the
language dialect specified by the name of the interpreter.

  The Scheme script interpreter may also load a different file after
making a reasonable check that loading it is semantically equivalent to
loading `<script>'. For example, the script interpreter may assume that
a file with a related name (say, with an additional extension) is a
compiled version of `<script>'.

29.3.1 An example of SRFI-22 script
-----------------------------------

Let us consider the following Bigloo script located in a file `foo.scm':

     #! /usr/bin/env ./execute
     (module foo
        (main main))

     (define (main argv)
        (print "foo: " argv))

  Let us consider the following `execute' shell script:

     $ cat > execute
     #!/bin/sh
     bigloo -i $*

  Provided that `foo.scm' as the execute flag switched on, it is
possible to _execute_ it:

     $ chmod u+x foo.scm
     $ ./foo.scm
       -| foo: (./foo.scm)

  The same Bigloo module can be compiled and executed such as:

     $ bigloo foo.scm
     $ ./a.out
       -| foo: (a.out)

29.3.2 Lazy compilation with SRFI-22
------------------------------------

SRFI-22 can be used to implement _lazy_ compilation. For instance, let
us consider the following shell script:

     $ cat > bgl
     #!/bin/sh
     SOURCEFILE=$1
     case $SOURCEFILE in
         *.scm)
             OUTFILE=${SOURCEFILE%.scm}
             if ( bigloo -s -o $OUTFILE $SOURCEFILE ); then
                 /bin/rm $OUTFILE.o
                 shift
                 ./$OUTFILE $@
             fi
             ;;
         *)
             echo Error: need a \*.scm file!
             ;;
     esac

  And the following Bigloo script:

     #! /usr/bin/env ./bgl
     (module foo
        (main main))

     (define (main argv)
        (print "foo: " argv))

  When executed in the following way:

     $ chmod u+x foo.scm
     $ ./foo.scm
       -| foo: (./foo.scm)

  The Bigloo module `foo.scm' will first be compiled and then executed.
Of course, one may consider more complex compiler drivers where it is
first checked that the module is not already compiled.

30 Compiler description
***********************

30.1 C requirement
==================

Instead of producing assembly code, Bigloo produces C code.  This C
code is ISO-C compliant [IsoC]. So, it is necessary to have an ISO-C
compiler. The current version has been developed with `gcc'
[Stallman95].

30.2 JVM requirement
====================

In order to compile the Bigloo JVM back-end, you have to be provided
with a JDK 1.2 or more recent (available at `http://www.javasoft.com').
The JVM must support for `-noverify' option because, by default, Bigloo
produces JVM code that is not conform to the rules enforced by the Java
byte code verifiers.

30.3 Running .NET programs on Microsoft .NET platforms
======================================================

Bigloo uses Portable.NET assembler and linker to produce .NET binaries.
As such, produced binaries are linked and signed against Portable.NET
runtime libraries and are rejected by Microsoft .NET platforms.  In
order to run Bigloo .NET binaries on Microsoft .NET platforms, binaries
must first be disassembled and then reassembled and linked against
Microsoft runtime libraries.

  The pnet2ms utility automates this process. Before the first use of
pnet2ms, a public+private key pair must first be registered to the
"Bigloo" container. You may either use the provided pair in the
bigloo.dotnetkey file or generate your own using:
               sn -k bigloo.dotnetkey
  The pair must be registered using:
               sn -i bigloo.dotnetkey Bigloo

  The pnet2ms program can be ran with:
       pnet2ms myprogram.exe

  Additional command-line options are:
       -initlocals     force all local variables to be initialized to their
                       default value upon function entrance
                       (for PEVerify to succeed)
       -k              Keep intermediate files
       -register       Register DLLs in the Global Assembly Cache
       -v              Enable verbose mode
       -v2             Enable very verbose mode
       -v3             Enable very very verbose mode

30.4 Linking
============

It is easier to use Bigloo for linking object files which have been
compiled by Bigloo. An easy way to perform this operation is, after
having compiled all the files using the `-c' option, to invoke Bigloo
with the name of the compiled files.

  When Bigloo is only given object file name as argument, it searches
in the current directory and the directory named in the `*load-path*'
list the Scheme source file in order to perform a correct link. Scheme
source files are supposed to be ended by the suffix `.scm'. Additional
suffixes can be added using the `-suffix' option. Hence, if source
files are named foo1.sc and foo2.sc, a link command line could look
like:

     bigloo -suffix sc foo1.o foo2.o -o foo

  Note: In order to understand how the Bigloo linkers operates and which
libraries it uses, it might be useful to  use the `-v2' option which
unveil all the details of the compilation and the link.

30.5 The compiler environment and options
=========================================

There are four ways to change the behaviour of Bigloo. Flags on the
command line, the `option' module clause runtime-command file and
environment variables *Note Modules::. When the compiler is invoked, it
first gets the environment variables, then it scans the runtime-command
file and, at end, it parses the command line.  If the same option is
set many times, Bigloo uses the last one.

30.5.1 Efficiency
-----------------

In order to get maximum speed, compile with the `-Obench' option.  This
will enable all compiler optimization options and disable dynamic type
checks. To improve arithmetic performance see next section.

30.5.2 Stack allocation
-----------------------

When the `-fstack' flag is enabled, the compiler may automatically
replace some heap allocations with stack allocations. This may improve
performance because stack allocations are handled more efficiently than
heap allocations. On some cases, `-fstack' may also cause slow down or
memory extra retentions. In this last case, when compile using
`-fstack' the program will consume more memory. Unfortunately, this is
nasty phenomenon is unpredictable (it depends on the nature of the
source file).

30.5.3 Genericity of arithmetic procedures
------------------------------------------

By default, arithmetic procedures are generic. This means that it is
allowed to use them with flonum and fixnum. This feature, of course,
implies performances penalty. To improve performance, you may use
specialized procedures (such as `+fx', `=fx', ... or `+fl', `=fl', ...)
but, it is possible to suppress the genericity and to make all generic
arithmetic procedures (`=' for example) fixnum ones. For this you must
use the compiler option `-farithmetic', or add the following module
clause `(option (set! *genericity* #f))' in your module declaration.

30.5.4 Safety
-------------

It is possible to generate _safe_ or _unsafe_ code.  The safety's scope
is `type', `arity', `version' and `range'.  Let's see an example:

     (define (foo f v indice)
        (car (f (vector-ref v indice))))

  In safe mode, the result of the compilation will be:

     (define (foo f v indice)
       (let ((pair
             (if (and (procedure? f)
                   ;; type check
                   (= (procedure-arity f) 1))
                   ;; arity check
                (if (vector? v)
                   ;; type check
                   (if (and (integer? k)
                         ;; type check
                         (>= k 0)
                         ;; range check
                         (< k (vector-length v)))
                         ;; range check
                     (f (vector-ref v indice))
                     (error ...))
                   (error ...))
                (error ...))))
         (if (pair? pair)
            ;; type check
            (car pair)
            (error ...))))

  It is possible to remove some or all safe checks. For example, here is
the result of the compilation where safe check on types have been
removed:

     (define (foo f v indice)
       (let ((pair (if (= (procedure-arity f) 1)
                  ;; arity check
                  (if (and (>= k 0)
                        ;; range check
                        (< k (vector-length v)))
                        ;; range check
                     (f (vector-ref v indice))
                     (error ...))
                  (error ...))))
          (car pair)))

30.5.5 The runtime-command file
-------------------------------

Each Bigloo's user can use a special configuration file. This file must
be named "`.bigloorc'" or "`~/.bigloorc'". Bigloo tries to load one of
these in this order. This file is a Scheme file. Bigloo exports
variables which allow the user to change the behavior of the compiler.
All these variables can be checked using the -help2 option.

  The Bigloo's runtime command file is read before the arguments are
parsed.

30.5.6 The Bigloo command line
------------------------------

If no input file is specified, Bigloo enters its interpreter.  Here is
the exhaustive list of Bigloo options and configuration variables:

31 Cross Compilation
********************

Bigloo is very portable and can be cross-compiled for most
Posix-platforms. As long as there exists a C (cross-)compiler for the
platform and the garbage collector is supported on the targeted
platform there is a good chance that Bigloo or Bigloo-compiled programs
will run on the platform.

  This chapter describes how to cross-compile Bigloo with a C
cross-compiler. Following established conventions we will call the
platform where the compiled programs should run the _Host_ platform and
we will call the build platform where we actually compile the programs
the _Build_ platform.

31.1 Introduction
=================

We assume that the host- and build-system are not the same, and that
there exists a C cross-compiler `CC' running on the build system
producing executables for the host system.

  In order to execute programs on the host, it is however not sufficient
to simply compile Bigloo-produced programs with this compiler. Indeed,
these programs depend on the Bigloo-library which thus has to exist on
the host-platform.

  Building a cross-compilation environment is done in two phases:
   * Build a Bigloo for the build-platform. Usually this is a given.

   * Build the Bigloo library for the host-platform. At the same time
     one might want to build the Bigloo-executable (for the
     host-platform) too, but this is not a requirement.

  Programs can then be cross-compiled simply by telling Bigloo to use
the host-library.

  Note: if the cross-compiled executable uses shared libraries, then
Bigloo's cross-compiled libraries have to be copied to the host
platform. Static executables are self-contained and can be run without
modification on the host.

31.2 Building the Bigloo library for the host-platform
======================================================

We assume that we have a C cross-compiler `CC' and an empty Bigloo
source tree. As a first step the configuration script must be executed.
However, Bigloo's configure script requires some runtime-information
from the host and thus needs access to the host-machine. This is
accomplished by passing a hostsh-script to configure.

31.2.1 Hostsh
-------------

A _hostsh_ script is passed to Bigloo's configuration script and is
invoked whenever a command should be executed on the host-side.

  There are already three example scripts inside Bigloo's source tree.
   * one asks (using KDE's kdialog) to execute the command by hand on
     the host-side and to report the result.

   * another one copies the file by `ssh' and executes it then on the
     other side. Note: there exists an Ipod/Iphone version that
     automatically signs on jail-broken devices.

   * and finally, as last resort, there exists a `netcat' version if no
     `ssh' is available. This one can be used on devices that only have
     telnet access, and where ssh is not available. Its only
     requirement is a running netcat on the host-side (which should be
     easily achievable since there exists a working cross compiler).

31.2.2 Building
---------------

Armed with a working cross-compiler `CC' and a script `HOSTSH' that
invokes commands and executables on the host side the configure
invocation is simple:

     ./configure -prefix=[PREFIX_PATH_ON_TARGET] -hostsh=[HOSTSH] -cc=[CC]

  Other configuration options are of course possible too.

  Once the configuration has finished one can build Bigloo (and its
library) simply by calling `make'. This will build the libraries as
well as the binaries.

  If shared libraries are needed on the host platform one still needs to
install them. The easiest way is probably to install them temporary on
a build system inside a special directory and then copy them from there
to the host system.

     make DESTDIR=[temporary-directory] install

  Only the `lib' directory is needed on the host side.

31.3 Cross Compiling Bigloo Programs
====================================

Once the host-library exists cross compilation is straightforward.
Using the `-lib-dir' compilation flag one simply has to pass the
library-directory to Bigloo.

     bigloo -lib-dir [path-to-cross-compiled-library] ....

  Bigloo will automatically use the same C cross-compiler and
compilation flags that have been used to build the library.

31.4 Caveats
============

In general Bigloo's cross-compilation works fine, but developers should
be aware of some limitations:

   * Macros will be executed on the build platform. The
     macro-environment (and in particular its integer types) might not
     be the same. For instance an `elong' on the build-system might be
     of different size than an `elong' on the host-system.

   * Bigloo will read numbers on the build system and adapt the
     container size accordingly. Suppose for instance that the build
     system features 64bit longs, but the host system only allows for
     32bit longs. The number 2^35 fits easily into a long on the
     build-system but will overflow on the host-system. The container
     will however be determined on the build system and thus a long
     will be used. This is only a problem for big integer literals.

   * A cross-compiled Bigloo uses (by default) the same C compiler that
     has been used to compile the Bigloo. Once the executable has been
     transferred to the host-system the C cross-compiler does very
     likely not exist anymore. Therefore Bigloo will need to be invoked
     with the `-cc' flag on the host-system (under the assumption that
     there exists a C compiler).

     This drawback can be eliminated by directly compiling Bigloo on
     the host (since there exists a C compiler).

31.5 Examples
=============

In this example we will show how to compile for a host-machine that has
ssh-access.

  We assume
   * a working Bigloo (should be the same version as the one that is
     going to be compiled for the host) in the PATH.

   * ssh access to the host. This access should be without password
     (using keys). The system should be accessible by `ssh [host]'
     (where `[host]' should be replaced with the correct address).

   * a C cross-compiler `CC' running on the build-system and compiling
     for the host.

  With these preconditions satisfied we can first build Bigloo for the
host-system:
     $ ./configure -hostsh="$PWD/examples/hostsh/ssh/ssh-copy.sh [host]" -cc=[CC]
     $ make
     $ make DESTDIR=[TMP] install

  Now let's compile a simple hello-world for the host.

     $ cat > /tmp/hello.scm <<EOF
     (module hello (main main))
     (define (main args) (print "hello world"))
     EOF

     $ bigloo -static-all-bigloo -lib-dir [TMP]/lib/3.2c/ -o /tmp/hello /tmp/hello.scm

  The generated executable should be able to run on the host.

32 User Extensions
******************

The extension package system allows the language compiled by Bigloo to
be extended and this is achieved by associating an _extension file_
with a suffix. The _extension file_ is loaded at the beginning of a
compilation and it can do three things: call extern programs (unix
programs); define macros; modify the values of some of the compiler's
variables (for example, the list of the libraries to be linked with).
The Bigloo's initializing procedure is the following:

   * If it exists, Bigloo loads the runtime-command file, see Section
     *note Compiler Description::.

   * It then parses the command line to find the source file to compile.

   * It extracts the source file suffix and looks it up in its
     `*auto-mode*' variable.  

   * If the suffix is found, the associated file is loaded. This file
     could contain a function named `*extend-entry*' which must accept
     a list as argument. It is invoked with the Bigloo's unparsed
     arguments.  

   * The result of the `*extend-entry*' application has to be a regular
     list of arguments and these are parsed by Bigloo.

  For now, two extension packages exist: the Meroon package which is a
native version of the Christian Queinnec object language; the Camloo
[SerranoWeis94] package which is a front end compiler for the Caml
language [Caml-light]

  Furthermore, Bigloo supports the `-extend' option which forces the
usage of an extension file. When Bigloo encounters this option, it
immediately loads the extension file, invoking the function
`*extend-entry*' with the list of arguments which have not been parsed
yet.

  The extension files are always sought in the directory containing the
Bigloo's libraries.

32.1 User pass
==============

Bigloo allows the user to add a special pass to the regular compilation,
this pass taking place _before_ macro expansion. There are two ways to
add a user pass.

   * Add a compiled pass: The module `user_user' (in the
     "comptime/User/user.scm" file) is the user entry pass point.  To
     add a compiled pass, put the code of the pass in this directory,
     import your new modules in `user_user' and modify the `user-walk'
     function.

   * Add an interpreted pass: Set the value of `*user-pass*', which has
     to be a unary function, in your `.bigloorc' file and Bigloo will
     invoke it with the code as argument.

33 Bigloo Development Environment
*********************************

Bigloo release 2.0 or more recent contains an Integrated Development
Environment. This environment proposes some services:

   * Automatic Makefile creation and update.

   * Code browsing.

   * Revision control.

   * Symbol debugging.

   * Profiling.

   * On-line documentation.

   * Source code interpretation.

   * Source code expansion.

   * Literate programming.

  The environment relies on Bigloo tools:
   * `bglafile': a Module access file generator (*note Module Access
     File::).

   * `bglmake': a Makefile creator.

   * `bgldepend': a that creates Bigloo dependencies in makefiles.

   * `bglpp': a pretty printer.

   * `bglprof': a profiler

   * `bgltags': a generator of tag file for Emacs.

  Each of these tools comes with a dedicated manual page and are not
described in this documentation.

  Extra tools are required for the environment to go its full speed:
   * `Emacs' version 21 (or more recent) (`http://www.emacs.org/') or
     `Xemacs' version 20.4 (or more recent) (`http://www.xemacs.org/').

   * `prcs' version 1.2.1 or more recent
     (`http://prcs.sourceforge.net/').

   * `gdb' version 4.17 or more recent (`http://www.cygnus.com/gdb/').

   * `gprof' (`ftp:/prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/').

33.1 Installing the BEE
=======================

The standard procedure for installing Bigloo handles the compilation of
all tools required by the BEE. Additional Emacs-lisp code have to be
appended to your `.emacs' file:

     (autoload 'bdb "bdb" "bdb mode" t)
     (autoload 'bee-mode "bee-mode" "bee mode" t)

     (setq auto-mode-alist
           (append '(("\\.scm$" . bee-mode)
                     ("\\.sch$" . bee-mode)
                     ("\\.scme$" . bee-mode)
                     ("\\.bgl$" . bee-mode)
                     ("\\.bee$" . bee-mode))
                   auto-mode-alist))

  This code will force `emacs' to switch to BEE mode when editing
Scheme source files.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Entering the Bee,  Next: The Bee Root Directory,  Prev: Installing the Bee,  Up: Bee

33.2 Entering the Bee
=====================

Once, your `.emacs' is updated, to start the BEE you just need to edit
a file suffixed with one of the suffix listed in AUTO-MODE-ALIST with
Emacs. You may either enter the Bee within Emacs with `ESC-X: bee-mode'.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: The Bee Root Directory,  Next: Building a Makefile,  Prev: Entering the Bee,  Up: Bee

33.3 The _Bee Root Directory_
=============================

The _Bee Root Directory_ is the directory that contains information
files that describe a project. When editing a file, the BEE tries to
automatically setup the _Bee Root Directory_. For that, it seeks one of
the following file: `Makefile', `.afile' or `.etags'.  This search
unwind directories until the root directory is reached or until the
number of scanned directories is more than the value of the list
variable `bee-root-search-depth'.

  An alternative _Bee Root Directory_ may be set. This is done clicking
on the `Root' of the tool bar icon.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Building a Makefile,  Next: Compiling,  Prev: The Bee Root Directory,  Up: Bee

33.4 Building a Makefile
========================

Once, the _Bee Root Directory_ has been setup (it is printed on the
left part to the Emacs modeline), a `Makefile' can be automatically
produced. It can be achieved clicking on the `Mkmf' icon of the tool
bar, using the popup menu (`button-3') entries, or using one of the two
keyboard bindings `C-c C-c C-a' or `C-c C-c C-l'.  When creating a
`Makefile', you will be asked to give a file name.  This file must be
the one that is the main entry point of your program or the one that
implements an library heap file.

  When the `Makefile' already exists, using the same bindings update
Makefile, re-generate `.afile' and `.etags' files.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Compiling,  Next: Interpreting,  Prev: Building a Makefile,  Up: Bee

33.5 Compiling
==============

Once a `Makefile' exists, it is possible to compile a program (or a
library). Use either the tool bar icon `Compile', the popup menu entry
or `C-c C-c C-c'. If no `Makefile' exists, the BEE will emit a single
file compilation.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Interpreting,  Next: Pretty Printing,  Prev: Compiling,  Up: Bee

33.6 Interpreting
=================

Scheme source code may be interpreted within the BEE instead of been
compiled prior to be executed. This facility could be convenient for
fast prototyping. A _Read eval print_ loop (henceforth _Repl_) could be
spawned using the `Repl' icon of the tool bar, using the popup menu
entry or using the `C-c C-r C-r' binding.

  Parts or the whole buffer may be sent to _repl_.

   * `C-c C-r b' sends the whole buffer.

   * `C-c C-r d' sends the define form the cursor is in.

   * `C-c C-r l' sends the s-expression that preceeds the cursor.

   * `C-c C-r t' sends the top level s-expression the cursor is in.

   * `C-c C-r r' sends the marked region.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Pretty Printing,  Next: Expansing,  Prev: Interpreting,  Up: Bee

33.7 Pretty Printing
====================

The whole buffer may be pretty printed (long source lines are split)
using the `Lisp' icon of the tool bar, using the popup menu entry of
using `C-c C-i <tab>'.

  Parts or the buffer may be indented (no line is split).

   * `C-c C-i d' indents the define form the cursor is in.

   * `C-c C-i l' indents the s-expression that preceeds the cursor.

   * `C-c C-i t' indents the top level s-expression the cursor is in.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Expansing,  Next: On-line documentation,  Prev: Pretty Printing,  Up: Bee

33.8 Expansing
==============

For debug purposes, result of the source code macro expansion may be
checked within the BEE.

  Parts or the whole buffer may be sent to _repl_.

   * `C-c C-e C-e' expands the whole buffer.

   * `C-c C-e C-d' expands the define form the cursor is in.

   * `C-c C-e C-l' expands the s-expression that preceeds the cursor.

   * `C-c C-e C-t' expands the top level s-expression the cursor is in.

   * `C-c C-e C-r' expands the marked region.

  When a part of the buffer is expanded (by opposition to the whole
buffer), the buffer is scan for macro definitions. These macros will be
used for expanding the requested form.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: On-line documentation,  Next: Searching for source code,  Prev: Expansing,  Up: Bee

33.9 On-line Documentation
==========================

On-line documentation may be popped up. This is always done, clicking on
the `Info' icon of the tool bar or `C-c C-d i'. If an emacs region is
active, the documentation about that region will be popped up.  If the
cursor is at a Scheme identifier, the documentation of that identifier
will be printed. Otherwise, the user will be prompted for the Section
of the documentation to be printed.

  Clicking on the `?' icon tool bar, pops up a short description of the
Bigloo compiler options.

  The BEE uses `info' files for printing On-line documentation. It
always search the standard documentation and the standard definition of
Scheme. It is possible to add extra `info' files to be searched.  The
BEE always checks for a directory `info' in the _Bee Root Directory_.
If such a directory exists, contained file will be considered for the
search of a document.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Searching for source code,  Next: Importing and Exporting,  Prev: On-line documentation,  Up: Bee

33.10 Searching for Source Code
===============================

Searching for source (variable declaration, module definition, variable
usage) is supported by the BEE. Clicking on the `Find' icon of the tool
bar will pops up the definition of the variable the cursor is in or the
definition of the module the cursor is in. These two operations may be
requested using `C-x 5 .' for searching a variable definition, `C-c C-d
m' for a module definition.

  Information and usages of a variable may be printed using either the
`Doc' icon of the tool bar or the `C-c C-d u' key binding.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Importing and Exporting,  Next: Debugging,  Prev: Searching for source code,  Up: Bee

33.11 Importing and Exporting
=============================

Bigloo bindings (functions and variables) may be automatically inserted
in an export module clause (*note Modules::). Bring the cursor to an
identifier of a binding that has to be exported then, either click on
the `Export' tool bar icon or use the `C-c C-m b' key binding.

  Bigloo bindings may be automatically inserted in an import module
clause.  Bring the cursor to an identifier of a binding that has to be
imported.  Either click on the `Import' tool bar icon or use the `C-c
C-m i' key binding. The BEE, will search the modules for the wanted
binding.

  Foreign bindings (e.g. C variables and C functions) may be
automatically inserted in the file module clause. Click on the `Extern'
tool bar icon or use the key binding `C-c C-m c' to import whole the
definition of an extern file. You will, be prompted an extern file name
to be imported.  This operation _automatically updates_ the `Makefile'
for reflecting that the extern file is required in the compilation.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Debugging,  Next: Profiling,  Prev: Importing and Exporting,  Up: Bee

33.12 Debugging
===============

The Bigloo symbolic Debugger may be spawned either clicking on the
`Bdb' tool bar icon or using the key binding `C-c C-b C-b'.  Once the
debugger is not is possible to connect the current buffer to the
debugger. This is done using the tool bar icon `Connect' or the key
binding `C-c C-b c'. This enables breakpoints to be inserted using
mouse clicks.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Profiling,  Next: Revision control,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: Bee

33.13 Profiling
===============

Automatically produced `Makefile' provides entry for profiling. In
order to get a profile you must first compile your application for
profiling.  This is done using a popup menu entry or the `C-c C-p c'
key binding. Once your program compiled you can run for profile using a
popup menu entry of the `C-c C-p r' key binding. This last will run
your program, run `bglprof' to get the profile and this will pops up a
window displaying the profile informations.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Revision control,  Next: Literate Programming,  Prev: Profiling,  Up: Bee

33.14 Revision Control
======================

Submitting a new revision is done using `C-c C-v i' or using an menu
bar entry. This builds an new revision for the entire project.  The
file that compose the project are listed in the `pop' entry of the _Bee
Root Directory_ `Makefile'.

  Checking out an older version of the file currently edited is done
using the key binding `C-c C-v C-o'. This is not a retrieval of the
entire project. Global check out may be performed manually.

  Comparing the version of the file currently edited with older one is
done using `C-c C-v d'. A _diff_ of the two buffers will be popped up.

  With both checking out and comparison of versions. A window presenting
all the available version will be popped up to let you choose which
version you would like to inspect.


File: bigloo.info,  Node: Literate Programming,  Prev: Revision control,  Up: Bee

33.15 Literate Programming
==========================

The BEE does not provide real _Literate Programming_. The reason is
that we think that when editing documentation we want to benefit the
full power of context-sensitive editors and we don't want to edit the
documentation is the same editor _mode_ as the one we use when editing
source code. Nevertheless it is possible to place anchors within the
source file to the corresponding documentation file. Then, by the means
of simple mouse clicks, it becomes possible to edit the documentation
of peace of codes. The current BEE literate programming system only
supports the _Texinfo_ file format.

  For that purpose three anchors are available: `path', `node' and
`deffn'. All anchor have to be delimited with `@' characters.

   * `path': this anchor set the path to the file containing the
     documentation. Thus,

          (module foo
             ;; @path manuals/foo.texi@
             ...)

     Tells the BEE that the documentation for the module `foo' is
     located in the file named `manuals/foo.texi'.

   * `node': sets the name of the node that documents this particular
     source file code.

          (module foo
             ;; @path manuals/foo.texi@
             ;; @node Foo@
             ...)

   * `deffn': each variable binding may point to its documentation.
     For that, it suffices to use the `deffn' anchor just before the
     variable definition or within the s-expression that defines the
     variable.

          ;; @deffn foo@
          (define (foo . chars)
             ...)
     or
          (define (foo . chars)
             ;; @deffn foo@
             ...)

     When clicking on that anchor, the BEE will search the
     documentation file named by the `path' anchor and within that
     file, will search for a _texinfo_ `deffn' command that defines the
     variable named in the anchor.
